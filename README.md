# Parkable

This is an app that shows parking spot availability in real time.

The following stack is used:
* Angular2
* Angular Material2
* Firebase 2
* Google Maps
* PhoneGap


There are several branches, most contain old work (react version, meteor version, angular 1 version).
The App branch contains the phonegap app that is used to generate the built apps.

Currently the database contains info about parking spots in Boston. The information is crowd sourced.
